### Intro to Ruby

Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (affectionately known as "Matz"), with the goal of being pleasant or, in his words, "natural" to use. If it's your first programming language, it might not feel very natural to begin with, but you'll get there and when you start to learn a second language you'll be able to make some interesting comparisons.


#### Strings



* Strings are one of Ruby's data types, they can store letters, numbers symbols/special characters so long as they are enclosed by double quote “ “. You can type a string into the Ruby interpreter and it will echo it back.
* Strings can be manipulated, you can join two strings together by “concatenating” them using the plus + symbol. Eg `"string1" + "string2"` outputs `"string1string2"`. The output is also called the “return value”.


#### Variables 



* Variables act as containers for information. We can give a variable a value by using the assignment operator =. Eg `greeting = "hello world"`. This is also sometimes called “declaring”. 
* Variables can be reassigned to different values, you do this by simply using the = operator to assign a new value to a variable that already exists, so we could change our greeting from “hello world” to “goodbye world” like so; greeting = “goodbye world”
